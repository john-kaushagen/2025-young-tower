\maketitle

\section{Introduction}
Just the standard abstract here.
What has been done before, and what is this related to?
\begin{itemize}
    \item Rogozin Paper
    \item That other guy who came up with the complex analysis stuff?
    \item Young Tower
    \item Decay of Correlations
    \item Renewal Theory
\end{itemize}

\section{Preliminaries}
Just put some initial results here.
What did Rogozin do?
What did Young do?
The helper lemmas for the convergence results can go here, although I feel like theres room for improvement here.

\section{Markov Results on Tower}
Here I'll show the results on the tower like stationarity, what the stationary measure is, etc.
I also need to give a proof of the renewal equation with the delay.

\section{Convergence Results for Bases and Measures}
Here, I'll give the proofs of the order estimates for the terms un, Un, Vn, and Rn.
Split the cases for alpha and beta.
Give the special case when I have monotonic sequences.

\section{Correlation (if I have time)}
What if the returns aren't independent but depend on the section they left from?

\section{Conclusion}
Summary of what I did, and maybe some future areas to work on.
